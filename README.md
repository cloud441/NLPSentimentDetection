![](https://i.imgur.com/AavAk5s.png)

## -- Description --
This project aims to build a NLP Sentiment Detection AI model for pedagogical purposes. The final result is a benchmark on multiple resolution methods with specific metrics to maximize. All of the result are related to IMDB dataset.

## -- Run the project --

The project is done in Python on Jupyter Notebook and final benchmark is saved in a PDF report (doc/report.pdf).

To re-run the Notebook, please follow this tutorial:

```sh
# If you are on Linux distro:
virtualenv NLP_env
source NLP_env/bin/activate # select the specific activate according to your shell.
# else, create a Python virtual environment with your IDE, and go inside.

# Install all python modules:
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Run Jupyter Notebook:
# If you are on Linux distro:
jupyter notebook & # the '&' run the command in background to let you use the console.
```

Be careful you can have 1 hour to run each notebook so if you want to run them again make sure you have time.

## -- Architecture of code --

* The 'doc/' directory contains the final benchmark report.

* The 'NaiveBayes/' directory contains notebook of the naive bayes model.

* The 'LogisticRegression/' directory contains notebook of the logistic regression model.

* The 'FasText/' directory contains notebook of models from FastText Text Classification module.


## -- Final results of benchmark --

please insert a screen of results (FIXME)
